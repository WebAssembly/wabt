;; The br expression breaks out of its if, without a value. Normally, the type
;; of the true branch would be i32, because the last statement has the type
;; i32. Since the br has no value, though, the true branch also has no value
;; so (i32.const 2) must be discarded. Since the true branch has no value, the
;; false branch must not have a value either, so (i32.const 3) is discarded as
;; well.
